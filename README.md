# 🎧 Podcastr
  
Project created on the **ReactJS** track during **Rocketseat**'s Next Level Week 5. The app made with ReactJS (Next.js) is used to listen to podcasts and has a brief description of each episode;
  
The site is generated using **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, thus improving the performance of the application, and uses a fake API to search for data from podcasts, requests are made using **Axios**;
  
The site is designed with the idea of ​​being a **Single Page Application (SPA)** so that the header and player remain static while the rest of the page remains dynamic.
